## Introduction

Welcome to my To-Do List App Project documentation. This project showcases a basic to-do list application with essential features for task management. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

I have successfully implemented all components of the to-do list app, providing features for adding tasks, viewing all tasks, and task-specific pages.


## Deployment Link

To view the To-Do List App, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Navigate through the different pages using the provided hyperlinks.


## Usage

To use the To-Do List App, open the index.html file in a web browser. From there, you can navigate to various pages, such as adding a new task, viewing all tasks, or accessing task-specific details.

## New Features

In addition to the basic functionality of a to-do list app, I have incorporated JavaScript for a more dynamic user experience. Users can add tasks, view all tasks, and access specific task details.

## Image Attribution

All images used in this project are not applicable as this is a text-based to-do list app.
